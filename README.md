# vectordbs

Vectordbs is a python library that supports all vector databases specifically for LLM apps and frameworks.

Currently all LLM frameworks and apps (Llama-Index, Open AI, Langchain, Baby AGI, etc) are all having to reimplement support for each vector database with a lot of redundant work, and this library is hoping to existing and new frameworks don't have to reinvent the wheel.

## Credits

The initial starting point of the project are based on existing work that happens in Langchain, Llama Index, Chatgpt-retrieval-plugin and Babyagi. Which is also the point of this project, which is help existing and future projects to not having to repeat the same work.
